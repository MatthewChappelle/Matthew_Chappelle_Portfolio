# Matthew_Chappelle_Portfolio
My first portfolio

I created a website where I can sample my work
Where it includes my name, photo, contact information, and nav links that scroll to their respective sections
When the first application is clicked, the image is larger than the others and the user is taken to the application page in a new tab
When the page is resized, the page adapts to the user's screen size
